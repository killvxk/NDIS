# NDIS
Windows Kernel Driver - Create a driver device in intermediate layer of Windows kernel based on NDIS, which communicates with and connect upper layer (user mode applications) and lower layer (miniport driver/network card).  Create self-defined protocols for transmitting data and control communications by simulating very simple HTTP, TCP and ARP protocols. Try best to implement connection establishing mechanism and retry sending mechanism following TCPâ€™s specification in order to achieve stable data transmission.  So it can walk around system TCP protocol layer and firewall to capture and send custom data packets.
